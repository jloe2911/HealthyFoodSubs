# Automated Identification of Healthy Food Substitutions based on Similarities in Nutritional Value and Flavor

The aim of this study is to help people to make healthier food choices, which also have similar nutritional and flavorsome characteristics than the food in question, through the use of deep learning. The knowledge graph of food is based on three open data sets, namely OpenFoodFacts (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), which is a food products database, and USDA (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html), which provides nutritional information of ingredients, and FoodDB (https://foodb.ca/), which provides flavorsome characteristics, which is defined as a combination of both aroma and taste. 

In order to capture healthiness, we will use Nutri-Scores, which is a French nutritional rating system, as our tool to discriminate between healthy and unhealthy foods. Thus, whenever we say that a food item is “healthier”, we basically mean that our recommendation has a lower Nutri-Score than the query food. Hence, the final algorithm consists of two parts. The first part finds food recommendations that have similar nutritional and flavorsome characteristics than the query food by using Graph Neural Networks. While the second part filters out recommendations that have a higher Nutri-Score than the query food, that are not in the same food category than the query food, and it ranks the remaining food substitutes according to their lowest Nutri-Value.
